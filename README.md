Word Guess Game

Author: Karina Chen

## Description
This is a C# console application that allows the user to play a word guess game. The user will see a main menu once the program is opened.

The user can choose to 1) view all the guess words, 2) add a new word, 3) remove a word, 4) start a game, or 5) exit the game.

The word guess game shows a hidden word and asks the user to guess the characters of the word. The user only knows the length of the word. If the user input matches any of the characters of the word,the character becomes visible. The user needs to keep guessing the correct characters of the word until all the characters are visible. Then the user wins the game.
